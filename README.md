# PHP-Exceptions-and-Power-Functions-Website---University-Project
This project was completed as a part of the Internet Technologies course, aimed at showcasing the usage and functionality of PHP functions related to exponentiation and exception handling. The project is presented in the form of a website built using HTML and CSS, with links to PHP files containing various examples and explanations. It is intended to educate and inform other students about these key concepts in PHP programming. Additionally, the HTML and CSS files that I prepared were validated by W3C website validation tool.
